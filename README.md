# CLI Chess

## How to play

1. Open your terminal application and navigate to the Chess folder.
2. Type "ruby lib/game.rb" (without quotes) and press enter.
3. To make the pieces easier to see, increase the font size of your terminal window.
4. Type 'e' at the prompt that confirms moves to exit prematurely.

## Dependencies and Technologies

I used the gem colorize to create the fun colors you see, and the gem require_all to nicely require the whole pieces directory without the messy code normally needed.
