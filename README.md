# CLI Chess

## How to play

1. Open your terminal application.
2. Type "ruby lib/game.rb" (without quotes) and press enter.
3. To make the pieces easier to see, increase the font size of your terminal window.
4. Control+c in Mac Terminal to exit prematurely.

## Technologies

I used the gem colorize to create the fun colors you see, and the gem require_all to nicely require the whole pieces directory without the messy code normally needed.
